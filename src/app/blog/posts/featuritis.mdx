I have been talking to a few start-up founders lately and most of them seem plagued by a recurring issue. Having reached a comfortable level of maturity, their product slowly grows into a bloated piece of software that is b
arely recognizable from its inception. The worst is that most of founders see themselves taking this path and 
some accept it as fate.

Fortunately, “featuritis” or “the tendency for the number of features in a product to rise with each release” is 
not fate. A Frankeinstein-like product is more likely the symptom of some structural challenges in a project, 
starting with an uncontrolled use of agile methodologies.

## The easy culprit: agile running without direction

Agile development is undoubtedly the most widespread approach to building software these days. 
Despite all its advantages, there is a hidden risk to it. Andrea Branzi saw it happen in architecture, when he 
characterized modern projects as constantly unfinished. Agile operates under the same premise. No product ever 
reaches a state of completion, there is always more to add, more to improve. This belief leads a lot of the 
decision makers to keep their agile team in full functioning mode, and guess what happens? Builders build, and 
will keep building unless told not to. Your product ends up with features that have no relationship with each other, 
don't serve any purpose except than keeping the development team busy.

## Building for the sake of building

I think this situation can reflect an imbalance of power within the project. Engineers love technical challenges, 
they love building, they love technology. Although an extremely valuable group, when engineers are exclusively in 
charge of the decision-making, there can be no end to the building efforts. There will always be something else to improve on. That's the beauty of the profession but also one of this most striking challenges.

Ideally, you want to have the three branches of the sacrosanct triumvirate of product design - Feasibility, Desirability, Viability - 
properly represented and of equal power. That is a challenge for an emerging startup as you may lack the skills, 
people or time to actually have these three perspective properly considered every time you think about product 
increments. This is when having a diverse range of advisers, partners or even friends, can be immensely beneficial. Pull on these resources, even if it comes at an upfont cost, because it will benefit your product more than you can imagine.

## Your product decisions reflects a well-understood product intent

So far, this diagnosis has nonetheless stayed on the surface. The symptoms I'm describing above are merely 
reflections of something that tends to disappear fast in a project: its initial intent. Beyond a product, 
having a clear picture of why you're building what you're building and what you want to achieve is far more 
critical than having the proper processes and people in place. Everyone can mimic that, but your intent is yours, 
it's your take on the world and it is unique. I have been a design lead for years now, and boiled down to its core,
this was my contribution: keeping the product intent alive, despite all the necessary trade-off that every build requires.

The question of intent is usually where my clients and partners struggle. Asking questions like “What’s your intent with this project? 
What are you trying to achieve?” usually get me blank stares or confused looks. 
They are critical though, because the clearer the answer, the more actionable it will be.

Actually, see a picture of your intent will help you land on a set of KEIs (“Key Experience Indicators”). 
In turn, these will help you navigate the different decisions that the project will need to make. 
New project increments, partnerships, target audiences, the benefits of clarity are numerous. 
This thought work is necessary, even when time is scarce. The cost of not doing it? Another product the world may 
not need, and a lot of wasted resources…

Next time you’re faced with critical product decisions, start thinking of how the next increment will benefit 
your intent, your vision. Don’t shy away from getting outside help, as synthesizing and keeping an intent alive is a skill. Good luck!
