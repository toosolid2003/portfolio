## In rentals, trust is broken.
Tenants drown in paperwork. Landlords make gut calls.

My rental dApp aims to fix that — by turning onchain rent payments into portable, verifiable trust signals.

[Check out the demo](https://www.loom.com/share/3302541d9f5e44fbb61649c54d600ab5?sid=041f4775-c4f5-4e8e-bc4f-e8ec9678af24)

The core flow assumed that the users had the skills to go online and parse a transaction history from Etherscan.
For the designer I am, it was too much of leap to ask. In other words, no one would do that. I needed another way
to attest of a payment, a more human-readble, easy-to-use way.

I wanted a solution that allowed tenants to create a portable history of their payments. It needed to be easy
to share, lightweight and easy to verify. Cherry on the cake: since some EU countries require landlords to 
send a payment receipt every month, I wanted this solution to automate this flow, so that landlords
wouldn't have to worry about this chore.

## Ethereum Attestation Service: portable attestations at your service
My research led me to the EAS and it was bang on. The attestations are light, easy to verify. The protocol itself
is open source and battle-tested. On top of that, the SDK was mature and they even provided cool UI platforms
to create, test and verify attestations. Perfect.

## Trust depends on the source: who to attest of the payment?
That was my main issue. A natural answer is the landlord, but since I wanted to remove that pain point from
their experience, I needed another solution. The EAS allows attestations to be generated by the contarct itself. 
In other words, the lease itself can be the attester - the source of trust behind the attestation. With that issue
out of the way, it was time to get coding. 

## Mature SDK, easy flow
I pushed all the EAS logic into a React hook. Easy to build and test. Wiring it to the overall flow proved to be
a bit of a challenge, unsurprising when you deal with multiple async flows in your UI (payment, attestaion, etc). 

Next steps on the roadmap: add a "share" button on the UI to collect, package and send the attestations to an email address. 
Then the overall flow would be complete, but we get a pretty good idea of the power of attestations with this MVP.
With the possibility to share and verify on-chain payments in a simple way, it tackles an underrated issue in 
Web3: trust in the technology itself. 

## Web3’s biggest struggle isn’t the tech — it’s trust in the tech.
We've all heard it: it's immutable, it's verifiable, always on, etc. The tech itself is great but it obviously
suffers from a narrative deficit that hinders its ability to attract and retain mainstream users. Asking non-tech users
to trust a fairly new technology, especially when money is involved, is too much of a leap, when the narrative
around crypto is filled with scams and security breaches. 
The EAS provides a good solution because it allowed me to mold the app into current, offline processes: the receipt
creation. An attestation is a good middle ground between the current paper or email receipt, often manually
generated, and the transaction hash that justifies a payment. It contains all the information a 3rd-party 
would be interested in: who, what amount, when.

## Web3 needs portable trust. No way around that.
There is a huge opportunity for portable trust in Web3. Integrating attestations into a user flow gives non-tech users 
some power back. They have a simple way of verifying them, displayed in human-readable format - rather than parsing
through transaction hashes. 

This rental MVP is just one example. Imagine what happens when reliability, governance, and participation all become portable.
If you’re building in trust x Web3, I’d love to explore how attestations can strengthen your product. DM me!
