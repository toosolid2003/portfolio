## Overview
In the current rental market, renters need to be able to reliably prove their good behaviour: 
paying their rents on time. Owners tend to request different tangential documents to build an assessment of that reliability,
without having the real hard data to back it up. This is especially relevant for people who travel internationnally
and need a way to prove their good behaviour across borders.

Hestia tracks rental payments on-chain and rewards renters with a score each time a rent is paid on time. By the end of
every lease, the renter has aggregated a sum of good behavious that he can carry with him to his next application.


## Key Features
- On-chain lease
- Automnated rent tracking
- Portable score (connected to an SBT)
- Composable anonimity, through ZK.

## Technology
- Solidity ^0.8.28
- OpenZeppelin Contracts (Ownable, ReentrancyGuard)
- Hardhat for testing & deployment
- ETH testnet compatible (e.g., Sepolia or Goerli)


## Outcomes
