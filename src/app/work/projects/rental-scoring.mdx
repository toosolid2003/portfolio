## Your past behaviour is the best predictor of your future behaviour
In the current rental market, renters need a reliable way to prove their good behaviour—most importantly, 
paying rent on time. Landlords often rely on tangential documents to assess reliability, without access to hard data. 
This becomes especially problematic for renters who move internationally and need to demonstrate credibility across borders.

Hestia tracks rental payments on-chain and rewards renters each time a rent is paid on time. 
By the end of a lease, a renter accumulates a score that reflects their payment reliability. 
This score can be confidently shared with future landlords to streamline the rental application process.

By leveraging blockchain, Hestia eliminates disputes about who paid, when, and how. Everything is publicly verifiable. 
To preserve privacy, wallet addresses remain anonymous, but each payment generates an attestation. 
These attestations not only spare landlords the headache of issuing receipts, but also serve as irrefutable proof of payment from renter to landlord.



## Key Features
- On-chain lease agreements
- Automated rent tracking
- Behaviour-based scoring system (paying on time = higher score)
- Certified payment attestations via Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS)

## Technology
- Solidity ^0.8.28
- OpenZeppelin Contracts (Ownable, ReentrancyGuard)
- Hardhat for testing & deployment
- ETH testnet compatible (e.g., Sepolia or Goerli)

## Going further
