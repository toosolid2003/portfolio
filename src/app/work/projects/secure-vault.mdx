## Overview
This project was created to help solve a Web3-specific issue: enable a collective to easily create tasks and attach
a reward to it. It was also a personnal exploration into full-stack Web3 building, helping me understand the technology
that will change the world.

## Key Features
- Public ETH deposits (up to 2 ETH)
- Owner-assigned hunter role
- Secure bounty claiming before deadline
- Refunds enabled after expiration
- Emits relevant events for all operations
- Fully audited for basic security threats

## Technology
- Solidity ^0.8.28
- OpenZeppelin Contracts (Ownable, ReentrancyGuard)
- Hardhat for testing & deployment
- ETH testnet compatible (e.g., Sepolia or Goerli)


## Outcomes
A fully functional micro-app, living on the Sepolia network, and ready for mainnet. I built it with composability inb mind,
making sure the code is safe and easily reusable in a broader app.
